First of all:

	http://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Getting_started

To configure the scripts and download the build metadata, do:

	$ ./oebb.sh config trikboard

Now all config files present to start build.
Main config is in  ./conf directory. For example, to build faster, change options in conf/local.conf:

       PARALLEL_MAKE     = "-j5"
       BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "5"

The number in this option mainly depends on number of available CPU cores on host (build) machine. We recommend ${NUM_CORES}+1.

Set environment variables:

	$ source ./build-environment-trik

Do not forget to source enviromnent config (build-environment-trik) each time before new build in fresh terminal session.

Now environment is fully prepared to build any package. For example, use following command to build kernel

	$ bitbake virtual/kernel

To build the whole image for microSD with TRIK firmware, run this:

	$ bitbake trik-base-v2

The command above also builds lots of additional packages, but not all. The first build of the whole image can take 4-8 hours, be prepared.

Additional useful packages can be build by following names

TODO: Table of traditional packages' names mapping to reciepts' names to build.
TODO: Add build times 


We work hard improving TRIK firmware, stay tuned and use 
	$ git pull
	$ ./oebb.sh update
to get updates

NOTE: The oebb.sh script tries hard to keep your local changes while at the same time keeping close to the original config. Please keep the following in mind:

	* it will reset the origin URI based on layers.txt, so update layers.txt when changing a repo
	* it will do a 'git reset --hard <ref>' on locked down repos, so please create a new branch for your changes
