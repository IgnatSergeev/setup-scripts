To configure the scripts and download the build metadata, do:

	$ MACHINE=trikboard ./oebb.sh config trikboard

You can change the 'trikboard' in the commandline above into the machine you are targeting.

To start a build of the kernel, source the environment file and do:

	$ . ./build-environment-trik
	$ MACHINE=trikboard bitbake virtual/kernel

For an example workflow for dealing with kernels please read http://www.slimlogic.co.uk/2011/05/openembeddedangstrom-kernel-workflow/

To update the metadata, do:

	$ git pull
	$ ./oebb.sh update

The oebb.sh script tries hard to keep your local changes while at the same time keeping close to the original config. Please keep the following in mind:

	* it will reset the origin URI based on layers.txt, so update layers.txt when changing a repo
	* it will do a 'git reset --hard <ref>' on locked down repos, so please create a new branch for your changes
